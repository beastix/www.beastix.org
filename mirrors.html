<h1>The Beastix project</h1>
<h2>Download locations - source code</h2>
<p>
Currently Beastix is available in source code form at the following locations:<br/>
<a href="http://www.github.com/beastix">Beastix at github</a> - this is the primary location for the source tree and thus the most up to date<br/>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/beastix">Beastix at gitlab</a> - this is a secondary mirror of the base system used for gitlab CI builds<br/>
</p>
<h2>Download locations - binary builds</h2>
<p>
Currently Beastix binary builds are distributed as bootable iso images from the following locations. Please use bittorrent where available:
<a href="http://www.beastix.org/downloads">beastix.org</a> - this is the primary location and the most up to date - please use bittorrent<br/>
<a href="http://1337.org.ly/pub/beastix/">l337.org.ly</a> - updated weekly, mirrors the latest iso build<br/>
<a href="http://www.jadedmeta.net/beastix.html">jadedmeta.net</a> - currently updated manually, mirrors all iso images</br/>
</p>
<h2>Becoming a mirror</h2>
<p>
If you are able to mirror either the source tree or the binary builds please get in touch at <a href="mailto:joinus@beastix.org">joinus@beastix.org</a> to get listed on this page. BitTorrent seeding is also an appreciated service to
help offset the bandwidth costs of hosting the binary builds - just leave your torrent client open after downloading and it will automatically seed.
